Tree level improvement in the SF
--------------------------------

These scirpts calculate tree level improvement of observables as
descibed by Divitiis et al. (*ALPHA* collaboration) in
hep-lat/9411017. The observables in observables.py are named as in
arXiv:1001.4783 (Blossier et al. for the *ALPHA* collaboration) and
the references therein.

calculate_tly.py  -- the main script
observables.py    -- store your observables here
tli.py            -- contains the actual tli function

Usage
-----

Further observables should be defined in observables.py.
Their tli can be calculated by adding them to the arguments dict
contained int calculate_tli.py.
